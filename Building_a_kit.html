  <h1>what is being prepared </h1>
  <h2>Being prepared is one of the main steps to surviving situations. When you want to build a kit to be prepared it is very important to list out what you want to be prepared for, what situations do you want to survive. Then list what equipment would help in that situation. I believe this is the problem with buying a prebuilt kit and the problem with following someone elses list of equipment you should have. You really don't know what they were planning on being prepared for. </h2>
