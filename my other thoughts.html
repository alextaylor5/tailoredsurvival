    <h1> Finances <br> 
    Different ways people retire
    </h1> 
    <div id="div1">
    Some people don't feel like they can save any money and they have not paid any SS taxes. So they work their whole life and get support from family. 
</div> 
<div id="div2">Others paying into SS for most their life but they have very little savings. <br>
</div>
 <div id="div3">The next level would be paying into SS and having some savings that can improve their quality of life. 
</div>
 <div id="div1">Purching a house and not waisting the equity on a secondary mortgages that is spent on non assets. This is a really good starting point for a good retirement. One of the big things to remember is if you don't have much money beyond the house you will probably be able to get your property taxes waved.  
</div>
 <div id="div2">If you have a house and you will also have a reasonable chunk of money in savings then you need to prepare to pay property taxes. Many houses that have been owned for 30 years are now worth $1M so a 3% property tax would be $30,000 a year. 
</div>
 <div id="div3">Those people that retire well usually have real estate and a moderate amount of savings. You give your savings to an investment advisor and they make a plan which spends your savings down to zero. At that point you sell the house you own outright and use that money to move into a retirement community. The investment advisor asks how long do you think you will live. Then they make a plan that spends your assets and savings to zero. If you live past that point you will be on SS Medicare and maybe help from your family. 
</div>
 <div id="div1">Next is having a huge amount of assets. People ask "How much money do I need to retire" they usually mean retire at the same quality of life that they had when they stopped working. Well that is different for everyone. But a simple calculation is 20 times the the amount of money you spent the year before you retired. lets say you spent $100,000. 20 times that would be $2M. a 6% return on $2M is $120,000 a year. You spend $100,000 a year and put the extra $20,000 back into your assets so it grows a little to keep up with inflation. 
</div>
 <div id="div2">You can also pay for lonterm care insurance which will cover you if you endup needing nursing services.

    <h1>Investing in the stock market</h1>
        
   <div id="div1"> When investing in stocks you should first analyzing the downside risk. <br>
    When trading stocks you should be using money you can loose and looking at the upside benefits then the downside risk</div>
    <div id="div2">
    When investing in the stock market a 6-8% return is normal.  This does grow your money but very slowly. <br>
    I you decide to learn how to control your own investmen ts a 20% return is possible.  This difference is massive. <br>
    $100,000 at 8% for 10 years is $215,892 <br>
    $100,000 at 20% for 10 years is $619,173 <br>
    But learning enough to do this is not easy <br>

        <h2>Risk in Investing</h2>
        There is risk in everything in life. Many of those risks are so small that paying attention to them just causes noise. 
        <br>
        The trick then is deciding which risks to study and wich to ignore. In finance that is not really tought anywhere.  
        <br>
        It is almost impossible to become rich without risk. If you believe that trading individual stocks are way to high risk I have a feeling you are either not willing to take the risks to get rich, or you have a path to getting rich that you see as less risky than stocks to you.

These processes result in elevation of ATP, cAMP, reactive oxygen species and intracellular calcium which impact downstream signalling pathways that triggers increase in anti-inflammatory processes, protein synthesis, anti-apoptotic protein production, cellular repair/metabolism/proliferation/migration and antioxidants.

<p> How do carrier proteins transport ADP and ATP in and out of mitochondria?

Scientists at the MRC-MBU in Cambridge, U.K., have discovered how a key transport protein, called the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier, transports adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the chemical fuel of the cell. This process is vital to keep us alive, every second of our lives, for all of our lives. This work will help us understand how mutations can affect the function of these proteins, resulting in a range of neuromuscular, metabolic and developmental diseases.

Cellular structures, called mitochondria, are the powerhouses of our cells. Every day, we humans need our own body weight in ATP to fuel all of the cellular activities. Nerve impulses, muscle contraction, DNA replication and protein synthesis are just some examples of essential processes that depend upon a supply of ATP. Since we only have a small amount of ATP in our body, we need to remake it from the spent product ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate using an enzyme complex, called ATP synthase, which is located in mitochondria. In this way, every molecule of ATP is recycled roughly 1300 times a day. For ADP to reach the enzyme, and for the product ATP to refuel the cell, each molecule has to cross an impermeable lipid membrane that surrounds the mitochondria. The mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier is involved in the transport of ADP in and ATP out of mitochondria.
The carrier cycles between two states; in one state, the central binding site is accessible for binding of ADP, called the cytoplasmic-open state, and in another, the binding site is accessible for binding newly synthesized ATP, called the matrix-open state. A key question has been how the protein is able to convert between these two states, changing its shape to transport ADP and ATP specifically, without letting other small molecules or ions leak across the membrane.

The paper, "The molecular mechanism of transport by the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier," published in Cell, describes how scientists have solved the structure of the carrier trapped in the matrix-open state. The carrier was trapped in this state by using a compound called bongkrekic acid, a lethal toxin that binds to the protein and stops it from working. The researchers could also rely on Nanobody technology. Nanobodies are fragments of llama antibodies, which bind specifically to the matrix-open state, and the structure of carrier-nanobody complex with bound bongkrekic acid was determined by X-ray crystallography. Together with earlier structures of the cytoplasmic-open state, this discovery reveals how the carrier works at the atomic scale. The carrier is incredibly dynamic, using six moving elements to transport ADP or ATP across the membrane in a unique and carefully orchestrated way.
The ADP/ATP carrier is just one member of a large family of related transport proteins that bring different compounds in and out of mitochondria, and based on this discovery, the scientists believe that this mechanism is likely to work in a similar way for the whole family. There are many diseases associated with dysfunction of these carriers and for the first time we understand how mutations affect their molecular function.

    <h1>Buffy the Vampire slayer</h1>
    <p>
        by episode 2 Buffy had aquired what no other slayer before her had, friends. And these friends would change the cycle of slayers forever. <br>
        And I found this on one site  ———-
        
        One of the most memorable episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is "Restless," which mainly consists of dream sequences. In one of these, two characters, Tara and Willow, talk while Willow paints Greek letters on Tara's naked back. The inscription must have been done hastily, because the initial letter in the eleventh line is actually calligraphed as a Latin "S" instead of a Greek "Sigma." For a long time, I wondered what the text was and doubted that it could be identified or reproduced. Happily, I learned that it is the poem "Immortal Aphrodite" by Sappho. While I am unable to present the text in actual Greek letters, I do offer below a transciption using Latin letters to represent the Greek text. While other websites (listed at the bottom of this page) can tell you more about this poem, no one else seems to have bothered to show how the calligraphy appears on Tara's back on television. I have done so here, complete with split words that begin at the end of one line and continue on the next. (Note that the only way of knowing how most lines end is to know how the next line begins, because the camera angle used in the television film shows us the left side of Tara's back far more clearly than the right.) While the words on Tara's back run together, I have put spaces between each word for the purpose of clarity, and I put a period at the end of the short line that ends the first stanza. I also finish the second stanza even though, in the television film, it is impossible to see whether the last line of the stanza has been completed or not. (If it is, the poem must continue on Tara's butt, which is not shown.)

        And here is Diane Rayor's translation of the above portion of the poem:
        
        On the throne of many hues, Immortal Aphrodite,
        
        child of Zeus, weaving wiles--I beg you
        
        not to subdue my spirit, Queen,
        
        with pain or sorrow
        
        but [ALLA] come--if ever before
        
        having heard my voice from far away
        
        you listened, and leaving your father's 
        
        golden home you came...
        
        
        
        It is worth noting that Sappho was not a dry poet in the modern sense, but a song writer. Unfortunately, the music that went with these lyrics has been lost. So, too, have most of her lyrics been lost.

    <h1>A student seeing someone shot vs A student being hit by a car </h1>
    There are 130,930 schools in the US. Lately there has been around 26 school shootings per year. So that is a 1 in 5000 chance a shooting will happen at any specific school. 
    <br>
    The shooter gets close to maybe 10% of the students. Now we are a 1 in 50,000 chance that an individual student would see someone getting shot. 
    <br><br>
    Approximately 25,000 children are injured each year in school zone accidents, with about 100 children being killed. This is mainly cars hitting kids walking home. This is what children should actually prepare for. 
    <br>
    Teaching every teacher how to deal with major trauma injuries is a real good idea. Telling students they need to learn this is traumatizing more students than the actual shootings themselves.

<H1>yahoo value over time </H1>

Verizon on Monday announced the acquisition of beleaguered web company Yahoo Inc for $4.8 billion. The fate of the company was finally sealed after months of speculation and struggle to find a buyer with mounting pressure from investors including Starboard Value LP.
<br>
Yahoo! was valued at over $125 billion at its peak in January 2000. it was all down hill from 2000 for Yahoo as one wrong decision after another continued to haunt the company. 
<br>
Yahoo! had the opportunity to buy Google for a paltry $1 million in 1998. But it had not yet created adwords
<br>
Today, Google's parent company Alphabet is valued at over $500 billion. this was mainly do to adwords and youtube
<br>
The opportunity came back in 2002 but Google's $5 billion price was too high for Yahoo!. 
<br>
Instead, Yahoo! acquired Broadcast.com in 1999 for $5.7 billion. 
<br>
This was pitted as the worst acquisition deals at the time, according to Econsultancy.com.
<br>
Yahoo!, in 2003, bought pay-per-click company called Overture for $1.4 billion. It lost that race to Google AdWords. 
<br>
Even acquisition of Flickr and Delicious failed to save the company's plummeting trajectory.
<br>
Reports suggest that in 2006, the company came very close to buying Facebook for $1 billion. The deal didn't go through. 
<br>
The company's value dropped to approximately $45 billion in February 2008 when Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo's outstanding shares and thereby getting a hold of 61% stake in the company. However, it refused to take the offer. 
<br>
By 2012 Yahoo!'s market cap dropped to below $19 billion.
<br>
This was when Yahoo! brought on Marissa Mayer as the CEO from Google, to save the ship from sinking.
<br>
While Mayer's appointment initially seemed to have worked as Yahoo's value in 2014 increased to $39 billion, however on taking a closer look it was the gains from its stake in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan that resulted in the hike.
<br>
She, too, turned to acquisitions and bought Tumblr for over $1 billion in 2013. The company, earlier this year, wrote-down most of this money. 
<br>
What's left of Yahoo!? 
<br>
Yahoo! owns 24% in Alibaba. 

The value of Alibaba in 2014 had sky-rocketed to $153 billion. 
<br>
The company also owns 25% stake in Yahoo Japan which was valued at $32.3 billion in 2014. 
<br>
In fact, by 2013 Yahoo started to receive more revenues from its investments in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan than its core business. The stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan had brought the company around $900 million during 2013 in comparison to just over $450 million from the rest of Yahoo.
<br>
Following the sale, Yahoo will be left with about $41 billion it invested in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba as well as Yahoo Japan.

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Yahoo! Wednesday reported higher first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street forecasts and raised its forecasts for sales and pretax earnings for 2003.
<br>The Internet media company said it earned $46.7 million, or 8 cents a share, on sales of $283 million for the quarter. Wall Street was expecting earnings of 6 cents a share and revenue of $274 million, according to First Call. The company reported a profit of $10.5 million, or 2 cents a share, excluding a charge from an accounting change, on sales of $193 million a year earlier.
<br>
Yahoo!, along with many other Internet stocks, has performed extremely well this year due to expectations of strong earnings and sales growth. Shares of Yahoo! (YHOO: Research, Estimates) are up nearly 40 percent year-to-date.
The stock sank 3.9 percent ahead of the earnings report Wednesday but gained more than 3.5 percent in after-hours trading, according to Island ECN.
<h2>Strong gains across the board </h2>
The company demonstrated strong results throughout its businesses. Advertising revenue jumped 38 percent from a year earlier on strength in sponsored searches (i.e., advertisers paying for higher placement in search results) and other forms of Internet advertising such as banners and pop-ups.
To that end, Yahoo! CEO Terry Semel said during a conference call Wednesday that traditional ad sales, those not from sponsored searches, also rose more than 10 percent from a year earlier.
<br>
Ad revenue accounted for more than two-thirds of Yahoo!'s revenue in the first quarter and the company has been renewing its focus on ad-dependent business, such as its searching capabilities, as the ad market continues to recover. Yahoo! unveiled improvements to its search engine on Monday.
Fees from services such as a DSL partnership with SBC Communications and premium e-mail products rose 61 percent, and revenue from listings, mainly through Yahoo!'s HotJobs.com site, soared 89 percent.
<br>
But Safa Rashtchy, an analyst with US Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said that fee-based revenues, which only increased 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2002, were a bit weaker than he expected.
<br>
Looking ahead, Yahoo! said sales for the second quarter should $295 million to $315 million, above analysts' average forecast of $292 million. For the full year, Yahoo! gave revenue guidance of $1.22 billion to $1.28 billion, ahead of the consensus forecast of $1.21 billion.
<br>
The company did not provide earnings-per-share targets but said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- watched by many investors -- would be about $85 million to $95 million for the second quarter and between $350 million and $380 million for the full year. The company's previous full-year EBITDA estimate was $295 million to $330 million.
<br>
During the conference call, Yahoo! Chief Financial Officer Susan Decker said that barring a big slump in the global economy, the company should be able to hit the higher end of its sales and EBITDA targets.
What about valuation?
<br>
But is this solid performance already priced into Yahoo!'s stock?
Rashtchy thinks that the shares have more upside because analysts will likely raise their earnings estimates for the year due to the company's upbeat outlook. The current consensus is 30 cents a share. Rashtchy does not own the stock and his firm has no investment banking relationship with it.
<br>
Still, Yahoo! trades at 76 times 2003 earnings estimates. Derek Brown, an analyst with Pacific Growth Equities, thinks this is a bit rich, even though the company is doing extremely well.
<br>
"The new guidance makes the valuation a bit more palatable, but it is still a bit stretched right now," he said. Brown does not own the stock and Pacific Growth Equities does no investment banking for Yahoo!
