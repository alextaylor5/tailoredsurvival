    Schematic diagram of the mechanisms of photobiomodulation near infrared light within wavelengths (630-1000 nm) targets the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase C resulting in (i) direct stimulation in mitochondrial respiration and (ii) dissociation of nitric oxide which indirectly increases mitochondrial respiration. These processes result in elevation of ATP, cAMP, reactive oxygen species and intracellular calcium which impact downstream signalling pathways that triggers increase in anti-inflammatory processes, protein synthesis, anti-apoptotic protein production, cellular repair/metabolism/proliferation/migration and antioxidants.

    put a clear box on each square with colorred tokens inside each color for a direction<br>
    once it gets to d4 then we remove each token of a wrong move <br>
    this is judging each move<br>
    
    now instead lets just judge the outcome<br>
    if it get to d4 in 4 moves we leave all the tokens otherwise we remove evey token pulled<br>
    this wont work very well, so allow it 10 moves if it does it put everything back if not remove everything<br>
    once it is good at that reduce it to 9 moves, then 8, then 7, ect<br>
    next do it again but when it gets it right put 3 of that color back in the box<br>

    <h1>Buffy the Vampire slayer</h1>
    <p>
        And I found this on one site  ———-
        
        One of the most memorable episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is "Restless," which mainly consists of dream sequences. In one of these, two characters, Tara and Willow, talk while Willow paints Greek letters on Tara's naked back. The inscription must have been done hastily, because the initial letter in the eleventh line is actually calligraphed as a Latin "S" instead of a Greek "Sigma." For a long time, I wondered what the text was and doubted that it could be identified or reproduced. Happily, I learned that it is the poem "Immortal Aphrodite" by Sappho. While I am unable to present the text in actual Greek letters, I do offer below a transciption using Latin letters to represent the Greek text. While other websites (listed at the bottom of this page) can tell you more about this poem, no one else seems to have bothered to show how the calligraphy appears on Tara's back on television. I have done so here, complete with split words that begin at the end of one line and continue on the next. (Note that the only way of knowing how most lines end is to know how the next line begins, because the camera angle used in the television film shows us the left side of Tara's back far more clearly than the right.) While the words on Tara's back run together, I have put spaces between each word for the purpose of clarity, and I put a period at the end of the short line that ends the first stanza. I also finish the second stanza even though, in the television film, it is impossible to see whether the last line of the stanza has been completed or not. (If it is, the poem must continue on Tara's butt, which is not shown.)

        And here is Diane Rayor's translation of the above portion of the poem:
        
        On the throne of many hues, Immortal Aphrodite,
        
        child of Zeus, weaving wiles--I beg you
        
        not to subdue my spirit, Queen,
        
        with pain or sorrow
        
        but [ALLA] come--if ever before
        
        having heard my voice from far away
        
        you listened, and leaving your father's 
        
        golden home you came...
        
        
        
        It is worth noting that Sappho was not a dry poet in the modern sense, but a song writer. Unfortunately, the music that went with these lyrics has been lost. So, too, have most of her lyrics been lost.

<p>Here is a statement from the developer from <a href="https://forums.ddo.com/index.php?threads/ddo-gear-planner-website.7294/">DDO forums</a> <br>
    I realized I ought to put a post on the new forums so that people can still find this. I built the DDO Gear Planner website a while ago to help solve your gear tetris problems. You tell it which affixes you care about, and it will suggest gear that has those things. It's also super helpful for figuring out what bonus types you're missing for a particular affix.

    The website lives at https://ddo-gear-planner.netlify.app/ and is mobile friendly!
    
    You can easily share your builds by copying-and-pasting the admittedly-long URL. For example, here's my <a href="https://ddo-gear-planner.netlify.app/#/main?levelrange=27,30&raids=true&hiddentypes=&Weapon=Staff%20of%20the%20Summer%20Solstice&craft_0_slot=Weapon&craft_0_system=Orange%20Augment%20Slot&craft_0_selected=Wisdom1&Armor=Legendary%20Bronze%20Dragonscale%20Plate&Belt=Legendary%20Black%20Satin%20Waist&craft_1_slot=Belt&craft_1_system=Nearly%20Finished&craft_1_selected=Wisdom3&craft_2_slot=Belt&craft_2_system=Green%20Augment%20Slot&craft_2_selected=Evocation%20Focus2&Boots=Legendary%20Sunken%20Slippers&Bracers=Legendary%20Cold%20Iron%20Bracers&Cloak=Legendary%20Scarlet%20Scale%20Cloak&Gloves=Legendary%20Sunstone%20Gauntlets&craft_3_slot=Gloves&craft_3_system=Blue%20Augment%20Slot&craft_3_selected=Wisdom2&Goggles=Legendary%20Collective%20Sight&craft_4_slot=Goggles&craft_4_system=Nearly%20Finished&craft_4_selected=Constitution13&craft_5_slot=Goggles&craft_5_system=Almost%20There&craft_5_selected=Constitution6&Helm=Legendary%20Crown%20of%20Snow&craft_6_slot=Helm&craft_6_system=Green%20Augment%20Slot&craft_6_selected=Transmutation%20Focus2&Necklace=Legendary%20Pendant%20of%20the%20Azure%20Sea&Ring1=The%20Legendary%20Shattered%20Onyx&craft_7_slot=Ring1&craft_7_system=Nearly%20Finished&craft_7_selected=Wisdom6&Ring2=Black%20Pearl%20Ring&craft_8_slot=Ring2&craft_8_system=Yellow%20Augment%20Slot&craft_8_selected=The%20Master%27s%20Gift&Trinket=Legendary%20Bottle%20of%20Shadows&tracked=Wisdom&tracked=Universal%20Spell%20Power&tracked=Universal%20Spell%20Lore&tracked=Spellcraft&tracked=Wizardry&tracked=Spell%20Penetration&tracked=Spell%20Focus%20Mastery&tracked=Healing%20Amplification&tracked=Sheltering&tracked=Physical%20Sheltering&tracked=Magical%20Sheltering&tracked=Constitution&tracked=Dodge&tracked=Resistance&tracked=Blurry&tracked=Parrying&tracked=Ghostly&tracked=Fortification&tracked=False%20Life&tracked=Speed&tracked=Freedom%20of%20Movement&tracked=Feather%20Falling&tracked=Blindness%20Immunity&tracked=Heroic%20Inspiration&tracked=Glaciation&tracked=Ice%20Lore&tracked=Evocation%20Focus&tracked=Transmutation%20Focus&tracked=Necromancy%20Focus&tracked=Devotion&tracked=Healing%20Lore"> Ice Druid.</a> If you scroll down, you can see that I have 30 out of 34 available points for Wisdom, and am missing the Exceptional bonus entirely. Clicking on any of the bonus type boxes shows you a list of gear with that bonus on it.
    
    I don't spend much time on it these days, but most of the data is pulled nightly from the wiki, so new gear shows up automatically. I occasionally push updates when inspired, so feel free to leave suggestions... or better yet, make your own contributions through the GitHub repo, https://github.com/illusionistpm/ddo-gear-planner

<div>There are 130,930 schools in the US. Lately there has been around 26 school shootings per year. So that is a 1 in 5000 chance on will happen at a specific school. 

The shooter gets close to maybe 10% of the students. Now we are a 1 in 50,000 chance that an individual student would see someone getting shot. 

Approximately 25,000 children are injured each year in school zone accidents, with about 100 children being killed. This is mainly cars hitting kids walking home. This is what children should actually prepare for. 

Teaching every teacher how to deal with major trauma injuries is a real good idea. Telling students they need to learn this is traumatizing more students than the actual shootings themselves.

when investing you are first analyzing the downside risk. when trading you should be using money you can loose and looking at the upside benefits
<br>
    ways people retire 
    they don't feel like they can save any money and they have not paid any SS taxes. so they work their whole life and get support from family. 
    paying into SS for most their life but they have very little savings. 
    paying into SS and they have some savings that can improve their quality of life. 
    the purched a house and did not waist the equity on secondary mortgages that they spent on non assets. This is a really good starting point for retirement. one of the big things to remember is if you don't have much money beyond the house you will probably be able to get your property taxes waved. 
    if you have a house and you will also have a reasonable chunk of money in savings then you need to prepare to pay property taxes. many houses that have been owned for 30 years are now worth $1M so a 3% property tax would be $30,000 a year. 
    those people that retire well usually have real estate and a moderate amount of savings. you give your savings to an investment advisor and they make a plan which spends your savings down to zero. at that point you sell the house you own outright and use that money to move into a retirement community. the investment advisor asks how long do you think you will live. then they make a plan that spends your assets and savings to zero. if you live past that point you will be on SS Medicare and maybe help from the family. 
    next is having a large amount of assets. people ask "How much money do I need to retire" they usually mean retire at the same quality of life that they had when they stopped working. well that is different for everyone. But a simple calculation is 20 times the the amount of money you spend the year before you retired. lets say you spent $100,000. 20 times that would be $2M. a 6% return on $2M is $120,000 a year. you spend $100,000 and put the $20,000 back into your assets so it grows a little to keep up with inflation. 
    you can also pay for lonterm care insurance which will cover you if you endup needing nursing help. <br><br>
    trading options on low volume stocks sometimes doesn't work.
