   <h1>Preparing for a house fire</h1>
     <p>Every day carry is what you have on you almost every day of your life. A lot of people will talk about first talk about self defence or firstaid.  Those are important but I like to start with the things every person probably has on them. Like a phone, Keys, watch, currency either a credit card or cash, and your personal medications. </p>
     <p>after that I go to firstaid.  a lot of first aid is bulky so I exclude that but there is a lot of firstaid that is really small like medication. asprin, Benadryl, </p>
