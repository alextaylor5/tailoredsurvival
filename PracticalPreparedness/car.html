<p>Put this kit in a place that will be accessable after an accident. I keep 2 in seperate places.</p>

    <h2>Car accident action card.</h2>
    Determine if there are any injuries  
    Call 911 if there is. <br>
    If someone is injured and in the way of traffic, do not move them, position a car between them and the traffic even if this impedes traffic. <br> 
    After dealing with injuries. <br>
    Move your car to the side of the road.<br> 
    Make car cameras save footage <br>
    Put on high visibility vest.  Put your car between you and the traffic. If you can not do this put on high visibility vest and put out flashers.<br> 
    <br>
    <h2>Information gathering check list</h2>
    Start a video on your phone. You don't need to point it at anything just the audio of what people tell you is enough.<br> 
    Exchange insurance information<br> 
    - take a picture of their proof of insurance. You can usually take a picture while you are also making a video. <br>
    - if they don't have proof of insurance get their phone number and address, get a good picture of them on the video. See if you can get a picture of their registration. If they ask for your registration, phone number, address, or drivers license inform them they can get that through your insurance company. <br>
    <br>
    Write down. Drivers names. <br>
    Write down passengers names if possible.<br> 
    <br>
    Don't discuss responsibility or your policy coverage. <br>
    <br>
    Take more pictures, but do not walk into traffic to do so. <br>
    - the location, 360 video<br>
    - The vehicles, especially license plates and damage.<br> 
    - Try to get passengers on camera. <br>
    - The vehicles vin number. Inside the windshield right in front of the driver. This is a good time to get video of inside their car and any passengers in the car.<br> 
    <br>
    Get phone numbers of whiteness's<br> 
    <br>
    Call police if there is any damage to vehicles or injuries.<br> 
    once you are in a safe place call your insurance company or use their app. <br>
    
    The most important thing is to stay safe. If you don't feel safe stay in your car and call the police. <br>

sugestions from friends

I would add a few things in the repair section:
Small shovel (gets you out of snow or sand, if stable and sharp can be a light axe, allows you to dig sanitation holes), zip ties, safety pins, cordage, wire, maybe a small saw

I also didn't see anything that would be usable as towel for a few days so a few of the compressed oned are probably a good idea.

Something as shelter if you cannot use the car / to make a car usable again for that purpose
