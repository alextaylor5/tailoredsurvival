    Only to you since it is so delayed.

I would add a few things in the repair section:
Small shovel (gets you out of snow or sand, if stable and sharp can be a light axe, allows you to dig sanitation holes), zip ties, safety pins, cordage, wire, maybe a small saw

I also didn't see anything that would be usable as towel for a few days so a few of the compressed oned are probably a good idea.

Something as shelter if you cannot use the car / to make a car usable again for that purpose
