  I spent over 3 decades trying to figure out what the perfect car preparedness kit was. I have finally figured it out, there isn't one. The best kit is the kit that has what you need when you need it. That is going to be different for every person. Then how do you decide what should be in your kit? What do you want to be prepared for?

Start with a list of the things that have happened to you in the last year. I bet if those things happened multiple times then you have already put something in your car to deal with that.
Next make a list of the things that have happened to you or your family and friends over the last decade.

This is what that list looked liked for me.

Then think about the things that might have, or did, made that situation easier. Put that down as the supplies you should have to be prepared for that situation. Grab a bag and acquire those items and put them in your vehicle. Now that's being practical about getting prepared for the things that will actually happen.

    <h1>What to prepare for</h1>
    <h2> </h2>
    <h2> When talking with people about disaster preparedness I like to ask them what they feel would be the most important item to have in a preparedness kit. I am always amazed at how many different answers I get.  I think the broad range of items I hear people talk about, very much speaks to the differences in opinion of what is meant by disaster preparedness. Some of the answers I have gotten are matches or lighter, flashlight, food, water, pocketknife, cell phone, medication, hunting knife, and firearms. I think people that answer with things like matches and a pocket-knife are mainly worried about situations where they will be separated from society and infrastructure. People that answer with firearms and hunting knives might be focused on self-protection and/or the major collapse of civilization. I like to focus on those things that have the highest chance of happening in the near future like medical emergencies, blackouts, accidents, and car problems.  I always keep a charged cellphone with me at all times because it is the number one thing that can help in all these situations.</h2>
  
    <p>.     You will find most people are already prepared for the things they do on a regular basis. If someone is always hungry I bet you find food in their pocket. Just look at what is normally in a woman’s purse and a man’s pocket. The trick is to figure out those things that might actually happen but you have not dealt with lately. And be prepared for those things. <\p>
    <p>   Surviving a situation goes hand in hand with being prepared for that situation. Equipment is important and is what I will talk about here and being physically, mentally, and intellectually are also very important.</p>

   <h1>Starting your Kit </h1>
    <p>It was a nice sunny day in the late summer of 2001.  My mom was home alone enjoying the view of her back yard eating some vegetables she just got from her fridge.  She started getting a weird feeling in her mouth.  Her tongue was starting to swell.  Being the quick thinker she was, she contemplated what she should do while dialing 911.  She was still able to talk but was becoming very worried about what was happening, and the 911 operator shared her worry. </p>

    <p>“Ma’am I want you to go get some Benadryl and take it right now.  You are probably having an allergic reaction to something.  And it should be the 4hr Benadryl not the 12hr or 24hr kind.  The 4hr activates much quicker.” </p>   
     <p>My mom did not have any Benadryl in the house so the 911 operator stayed on the line with her while she drove to the pharmacy and purchased some Benadryl.  The operator told her to take it while still in the pharmacy and wait there for a half an hour so if things did not improve she would be around people that could help.</p>  
     <P>What my mom figured out later was that there was probably a bug in the vegetables she ate and she had an allergic reaction to it.  Everything worked out fine. She learned how helpful the 911 operators can be and learned to never be without Benadryl somewhere nearby.</P>
     <p>One of the morals of this story is how important it is to have easy access to 911, having a charged cellphone is a good way of making sure 911 is available.  It is also a good idea to have some basic supplies available that the 911 operator my want you to use right there.  Some of the things they might ask for are aspirin, allergy tablets, hand sanitizer, hydrocortisone cream, Band-Aids, topical antibiotic (Neosporin), alcohol pads, antiseptic wipes, tweezers, and a thermometer.</p>
     <p>Some of the reasons a 911 operator might ask you to use these things are giving an aspirin for someone who is having a heart attack.  Allergy tablets for someone who got a bug bite or bee sting.  Hydrocortisone cream poison ivy or itchy skin.  A thermometer to check if someone needs to be treated for hypothermia or heat stroke.</p>
