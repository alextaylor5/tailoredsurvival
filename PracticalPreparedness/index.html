    <h1>The Best Kit</h1>
    <p>  I spent over 3 decades trying to figure out what the perfect car preparedness kit was. I have finally figured it out, there isn't one. The best kit is the kit that has what you need when you need it. That is going to be different for every person. Then how do you decide what should be in your kit? What do you want to be prepared for?

Start with a list of the things that have happened to you in the last year. I bet if those things happened multiple times then you have already put something in your car to deal with that.
Next make a list of the things that have happened to you or your family and friends over the last decade.

This is what that list looked liked for me.

Then think about the things that might have, or did, made that situation easier. Put that down as the supplies you should have to be prepared for that situation. Grab a bag and acquire those items and put them in your vehicle. Now that's being practical about getting prepared for the things that will actually happen.

    <h1>Surviving situations</h1>
    <h2> hi </h2>
    <h2> When talking with people about disaster preparedness I like to ask them what they feel would be the most important item to have in a preparedness kit. I am always amazed at how many different answers I get.  I think the broad range of items I hear people talk about, very much speaks to the differences in opinion of what is meant by disaster preparedness. Some of the answers I have gotten are matches or lighter, flashlight, food, water, pocketknife, cell phone, medication, hunting knife, and firearms. I think people that answer with things like matches and a pocket-knife are mainly worried about situations where they will be separated from society and infrastructure. People that answer with firearms and hunting knives might be focused on self-protection and/or the major collapse of civilization. I like to focus on those things that have the highest chance of happening in the near future like medical emergencies, blackouts, accidents, and car problems.  I always keep a charged cellphone with me at all times because it is the number one thing that can help in all these situations.</h2>

    <p> This website will try to focus on those situations that have the highest chance of happening in the near future, with a major focus on anything that could be life threatening. I believe if you start by being prepared for those things you are more than halfway to the point of being prepared for the larger disasters like earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters.</p>
    <p>.     You will find most people are already prepared for the things they do on a regular basis. If someone is always hungry I bet you find food in their pocket. Just look at what is normally in a woman’s purse and a man’s pocket. The trick is to figure out those things that might actually happen but you have not dealt with lately. And be prepared for those things.  Surviving a situation goes hand in hand with being prepared for that situation. Equipment is important and is what I will talk about here and being physically, mentally, and intellectually are also very important.</p>
