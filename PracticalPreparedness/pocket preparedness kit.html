<div id="div2"> <p>As always we are going to start with a list of things we want to be prepared for. Then we will decide what is a good item to have to help in that situation.  Since this kit is going to be in my pocket at all times I want to focus on situations where people might be at risk of dying or ending up in the hospital. Plus things that could permenently scar someone. When building your pocket kit think about the most important things you would could possibly deal with in your life and make sure they are part of the list of things you want to be prepared for. </p></div>

   <p>All of this is what a lot of people call Every day carry.  Every day carry is what you have on you almost every day of your life. A lot of people will first talk about self defence or firstaid.  Those are important but as you can see above I like to start with the things every person probably has on them. Like a phone, Keys, watch, currency either a credit card or cash, and your personal medications. </p>
     <p>after that I go to firstaid.  a lot of first aid is bulky so I exclude that but there is a lot of firstaid that is really small like medication. asprin, Benadryl, </p>
