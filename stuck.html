    <h1> stuck because of a flood</h1>
    <p> The next type of emergency that has happened to me lately is just getting stuck away from my house unexpectedly for more than 24 hours.  Having your medications, extra glasses, other medical devices, plus some toiletries is a great idea.  Having these things can turn a very worrisome situation into a nonevent.  I live in an area that floods a lot so this happens every couple of years.  In 200x my wife left work early to make it home before the roads closed but missed it by 10 min so had to drive to her bothers to sleep for the night.  She has not been without a tooth brush and medications in her car since.
    One thing about storing medications in your car is the temperature problem.  Most medications say done store above 90 degrees.  If your car sits in the sun for any amount of time the cabin can go above 90 degrees very quickly.  The glove compartment and some trunks stay cooler for a lot longer but will heat up eventually.  What I do is store a couple of chocolate bars in the same zip lock bag that has my medications are in.  Since chocolate melts at around 90 degrees, if I ever see that the chocolate bars have melted and changed shape I know I might need to replace my medications.  Plus, having some chocolate in my kit is the nicest way to get me some calories in a stressful situation.
