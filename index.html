    <h1>What to prepare for</h1>
    <h2> </h2>
    <h2> When talking with people about disaster preparedness I like to ask them what they feel would be the most important item to have in a preparedness kit. I am always amazed at how many different answers I get.  I think the broad range of items I hear people talk about, very much speaks to the differences in opinion of what is meant by disaster preparedness. Some of the answers I have gotten are matches or lighter, flashlight, food, water, pocketknife, cell phone, medication, hunting knife, and firearms. I think people that answer with things like matches and a pocket-knife are mainly worried about situations where they will be separated from society and infrastructure. People that answer with firearms and hunting knives might be focused on self-protection and/or the major collapse of civilization. I like to focus on those things that have the highest chance of happening in the near future like medical emergencies, blackouts, accidents, and car problems.  I always keep a charged cellphone with me at all times because it is the number one thing that can help in all these situations.</h2>
  
    <p>.     You will find most people are already prepared for the things they do on a regular basis. If someone is always hungry I bet you find food in their pocket. Just look at what is normally in a woman’s purse and a man’s pocket. The trick is to figure out those things that might actually happen but you have not dealt with lately. And be prepared for those things. <\p>
    <p>   Surviving a situation goes hand in hand with being prepared for that situation. Equipment is important and is what I will talk about here and being physically, mentally, and intellectually are also very important.</p>
