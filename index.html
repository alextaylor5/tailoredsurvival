   <h1>Starting your Kit </h1>
    <p>It was a nice sunny day in the late summer of 2001.  My mom was home alone enjoying the view of her back yard eating some vegetables she just got from her fridge.  She started getting a weird feeling in her mouth.  Her tongue was starting to swell.  Being the quick thinker she was, she contemplated what she should do while dialing 911.  She was still able to talk but was becoming very worried about what was happening, and the 911 operator shared her worry. </p>

    <p>“Ma'am I want you to go get some Benadryl and take it right now.  You are probably having an allergic reaction to something.  And it should be the 4hr Benadryl not the 12hr or 24hr kind.  The 4hr activates much quicker.” </p>   
     <p>My mom did not have any Benadryl in the house so the 911 operator stayed on the line with her while she drove to the pharmacy and purchased some Benadryl.  The operator told her to take it while still in the pharmacy and wait there for a half an hour so if things did not improve she would be around people that could help.</p>  
     <P>What my mom figured out later was that there was probably a bug in the vegetables she ate and she had an allergic reaction to it.  Everything worked out fine. She learned how helpful the 911 operators can be and learned to never be without Benadryl somewhere nearby.</P>
     <p>One of the morals of this story is how important it is to have easy access to 911, having a charged cellphone is a good way of making sure 911 is available.  It is also a good idea to have some basic supplies available that the 911 operator my want you to use right there.  Some of the things they might ask for are aspirin, allergy tablets, hand sanitizer, hydrocortisone cream, Band-Aids, topical antibiotic (Neosporin), alcohol pads, antiseptic wipes, tweezers, and a thermometer.</p>
     <p>Some of the reasons a 911 operator might ask you to use these things are giving an aspirin for someone who is having a heart attack.  Allergy tablets for someone who got a bug bite or bee sting.  Hydrocortisone cream poison ivy or itchy skin.  A thermometer to check if someone needs to be treated for hypothermia or heat stroke.</p>
