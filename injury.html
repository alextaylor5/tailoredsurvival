 Since medical issues and accidents are 2 of the biggest emergencies people will run into in their life being well prepared for both is top priority.  Expanding your first aid kit is an easy way to focus on this.  A good place to start is getting a small first aid guide and having the things that will help you deal with injuries easily available to you.  I had a hard time finding a good first aid pamphlet on line for free so I have made a website that links to a lot of good resources.  www.freefirstaidguide.com.  Everybodyâ€™s medical knowledge is different so remember to put things into your kit that is specific to your knowledge.  Here is a good list to start with that most everyone knows how to use.  Gauze pads, paper tape, scissors, Pepto-Bismol, anti-diarrhea pills, Vaseline, sunscreen, and pain medication.
