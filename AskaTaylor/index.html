    <h3>Charging</h3>
    I think the most important thing to thinkabout is the data someone can access with your phone <br>
    Then I thinkabout how to keep my phone charged. <br>
    This brings up the situation of how dangerous public charge ports are. <br>
    It is very easy for a hacker to make a public charge port not just be a charge port but also a data port capable of accessing your phone.  This means pluging your phone into a public charging port or cable is a really bad idea.  So how do we keep our phones charged? Use a small battery pack.  You can charge your batterypack anywhere you would like there is no data on it to be stolen.  If the charging device creates a voltage spike it only damages a $20 battery pack not a $1000 phone. <br>
    <br>
    Even in your hotel it is not a bad idea to only use a batterypack to charge your phone.  Again this will protect your device from power spikes in the hotel.  I like to use my own surge protector in a hotel room but that is not always possible. So charging a battery pack then charge your phone is a way I protect my expensive devices. <br>
    Laptops can also use this technique if you have a good batterypack and your laptop power input is USB-C. You can get a batterypack with USB-C 30 watt PD (power delivery) port for only $20.  A 60W PD battery pack is probably over $50 right now. <br>

<div id="dont destroy your data"><h1>Don't destroy your data.</h1></div>
When using a computer there are a couple ways you can acidentally destroy your data.  The number 1 way is unpluging a usb hard drive or thumb drive. If you dont eject a drive before unpluging it from the USB port there is a very small chance that it was in the middle of writing somthing to the drive.  If it is interupted half way through writing something then the entire drive can get corupted. Which can make you very sad if it was photos from 40 years ago.  Now technically Seagate can recover just about anything off of a drive but that can be $50-$2000. <br>
So to eject a drive find the thumb drive icon next to the clock. Click that once. It will give you a list of devices you can eject so you can safely unplug them.

First of all try and always use the chip reader, touchless reader, or just touch your phone to the card reader.  These make it very hard for the businesses your are spending your money at to steal your credit card number. If you use your magnetic strip in a machine it is very easy for a hacker or that business to get all the information off that strip. Like the card number, your name, expiration date, and the card verification code. <br>
    If you are using an ATM card and a false transaction happens you are responsible of proving it is a false transaction before the bank gives you your money back. <br>
    If you are using an actual Credit Card and a false transaction happens the credit card company is legally required to remove to transaction, and then it is their responsibility of proving you made the transaction before they add the transaction back onto your account. <br>

These processes result in elevation of ATP, cAMP, reactive oxygen species and intracellular calcium which impact downstream signalling pathways that triggers increase in anti-inflammatory processes, protein synthesis, anti-apoptotic protein production, cellular repair/metabolism/proliferation/migration and antioxidants.

<p> How do carrier proteins transport ADP and ATP in and out of mitochondria?

Scientists at the MRC-MBU in Cambridge, U.K., have discovered how a key transport protein, called the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier, transports adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the chemical fuel of the cell. This process is vital to keep us alive, every second of our lives, for all of our lives. This work will help us understand how mutations can affect the function of these proteins, resulting in a range of neuromuscular, metabolic and developmental diseases.

Cellular structures, called mitochondria, are the powerhouses of our cells. Every day, we humans need our own body weight in ATP to fuel all of the cellular activities. Nerve impulses, muscle contraction, DNA replication and protein synthesis are just some examples of essential processes that depend upon a supply of ATP. Since we only have a small amount of ATP in our body, we need to remake it from the spent product ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate using an enzyme complex, called ATP synthase, which is located in mitochondria. In this way, every molecule of ATP is recycled roughly 1300 times a day. For ADP to reach the enzyme, and for the product ATP to refuel the cell, each molecule has to cross an impermeable lipid membrane that surrounds the mitochondria. The mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier is involved in the transport of ADP in and ATP out of mitochondria.
The carrier cycles between two states; in one state, the central binding site is accessible for binding of ADP, called the cytoplasmic-open state, and in another, the binding site is accessible for binding newly synthesized ATP, called the matrix-open state. A key question has been how the protein is able to convert between these two states, changing its shape to transport ADP and ATP specifically, without letting other small molecules or ions leak across the membrane.

The paper, "The molecular mechanism of transport by the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier," published in Cell, describes how scientists have solved the structure of the carrier trapped in the matrix-open state. The carrier was trapped in this state by using a compound called bongkrekic acid, a lethal toxin that binds to the protein and stops it from working. The researchers could also rely on Nanobody technology. Nanobodies are fragments of llama antibodies, which bind specifically to the matrix-open state, and the structure of carrier-nanobody complex with bound bongkrekic acid was determined by X-ray crystallography. Together with earlier structures of the cytoplasmic-open state, this discovery reveals how the carrier works at the atomic scale. The carrier is incredibly dynamic, using six moving elements to transport ADP or ATP across the membrane in a unique and carefully orchestrated way.
The ADP/ATP carrier is just one member of a large family of related transport proteins that bring different compounds in and out of mitochondria, and based on this discovery, the scientists believe that this mechanism is likely to work in a similar way for the whole family. There are many diseases associated with dysfunction of these carriers and for the first time we understand how mutations affect their molecular function.

    <h1>Buffy the Vampire slayer</h1>
    <p>
        by episode 2 Buffy had aquired what no other slayer before her had, friends. And these friends would change the cycle of slayers forever. <br>
        And I found this on one site  ———-
        
        One of the most memorable episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is "Restless," which mainly consists of dream sequences. In one of these, two characters, Tara and Willow, talk while Willow paints Greek letters on Tara's naked back. The inscription must have been done hastily, because the initial letter in the eleventh line is actually calligraphed as a Latin "S" instead of a Greek "Sigma." For a long time, I wondered what the text was and doubted that it could be identified or reproduced. Happily, I learned that it is the poem "Immortal Aphrodite" by Sappho. While I am unable to present the text in actual Greek letters, I do offer below a transciption using Latin letters to represent the Greek text. While other websites (listed at the bottom of this page) can tell you more about this poem, no one else seems to have bothered to show how the calligraphy appears on Tara's back on television. I have done so here, complete with split words that begin at the end of one line and continue on the next. (Note that the only way of knowing how most lines end is to know how the next line begins, because the camera angle used in the television film shows us the left side of Tara's back far more clearly than the right.) While the words on Tara's back run together, I have put spaces between each word for the purpose of clarity, and I put a period at the end of the short line that ends the first stanza. I also finish the second stanza even though, in the television film, it is impossible to see whether the last line of the stanza has been completed or not. (If it is, the poem must continue on Tara's butt, which is not shown.)

        And here is Diane Rayor's translation of the above portion of the poem:
        
        On the throne of many hues, Immortal Aphrodite,
        
        child of Zeus, weaving wiles--I beg you
        
        not to subdue my spirit, Queen,
        
        with pain or sorrow
        
        but [ALLA] come--if ever before
        
        having heard my voice from far away
        
        you listened, and leaving your father's 
        
        golden home you came...
        
        
        
        It is worth noting that Sappho was not a dry poet in the modern sense, but a song writer. Unfortunately, the music that went with these lyrics has been lost. So, too, have most of her lyrics been lost.

    <h1>A student seeing someone shot vs <br> A student being hit by a car </h1>
    There are 130,930 schools in the US. Lately there has been around 26 school shootings per year. So that is a 1 in 5000 chance a shooting will happen at any specific school. 
    <br>
    The shooter gets close to maybe 10% of the students. Now we are a 1 in 50,000 chance that an individual student would see someone getting shot. 
    <br><br>
    Approximately 25,000 children are injured each year in school zone accidents, with about 100 children being killed. This is mainly cars hitting kids walking home. This is what children should actually prepare for.
