  <h1>  Teaching finances to children. </h1>
<p>
    At some point children should be given responsibility for some of their own finances.  This is one of the best ways to get them to understand money and eventually financial planning. When children graduate grade school is a great time to start this.  You can incorporate this into the big life change of transitioning to Middle School. During this transition many kids will feel a loss of control of their life. So giving them control of some of their own money can balance this fact. Here are some things you can do to give them control of their own money.
    <br> <br>Open them a checking account with an atm card (Age 12 and under)
    <br>Open them a Savings account and make them an autorized user on an American Express card (13 and older)
    <br>Give them a way to make money that they control so they can put their own money into their checking and savings. I like to call these Income tasks.  
    <br><br>Here is an example list
    <br>- doing a load of towels
    <br>- folding and putting away clean Towels
    <br>- Washing the car
    <br>- Vacuuming the carpet
    <br>
    <br>I feel these need to be very different from their chores.  Chores are something they have been told to do and can build responsibility.  Income tasks are something they are allowed to do and that they get paid for but are never expected to do.  They do them because they want to generate income to buy things, not because they were told to do them.
    <br>
    <br>Now they need a way to access their money. For ages 12 and under this will be an atm card, I have not found a credit card for a child below age 13.  A guardian must also be on the account and is liable for all activities on the account. I like credit unions like <a href="https://www.becu.org/everyday-banking/teen-checking">BECU</a> and <a href="https://mobile.usaa.com/inet/wc/youth-checking-account">USAA bank</a> for this option. For ages 13 to 18 they can be added as an  authorized user on a parents credit card.  American Express is the only card I know of that will allow you to put spending limits on authorized users. So if it is not an Amex maybe have it have a credit limit of under $1000.  
    
   <h1> Other ideas for teaching finances. </h1> 
- 3 day rule when they ask you to buy them something. Or when they ask to borrow money to buy something 
- 3 month rule for high schoolers. 
- give them control of their own spending in a certain area. I was given a clothing budget each year. I was not given more money than that for clothing throughout the year. That was it. Increase this amount each year. <br><br>

The $1000 finance meeting (maybe $50 per year of age). A time for them to ask questions not a time to preach at them. 
List of suggestions for them
- download their 3 credit reports 
- ask what plans do they have for money over the next year and decade. You can keep this information in mind for future conversations but do not give input at this point. We do not want them to feel judged at all about finances. The important thing is for them to be thinking about finances not for them to get their finances right the first time. If you want to communicate something about finances maybe implementing your opinions on your own finances is better than preaching something you don't practice yourself.
- When they decide the meeting is done give them the money in the way that works best for them.  
- If they put it into a retirement account I double the amount.

    <h1>     Different ways people retire    </h1> 
<div id="div1">
    Some people don't feel like they can save any money and they have not paid any SS taxes. So they work their whole life and get support from family. 
</div> 
<div id="div2">Others paying into SS for most their life but they have very little savings. <br>
</div>
 <div id="div3">The next level would be paying into SS and having some savings that can improve their quality of life. 
</div>
 <div id="div1">Purching a house and not waisting the equity on a secondary mortgages that is spent on non assets. This is a really good starting point for a good retirement. One of the big things to remember is if you don't have much money beyond the house you will probably be able to get your property taxes waved.  
</div>
 <div id="div2">If you have a house and you will also have a reasonable chunk of money in savings then you need to prepare to pay property taxes. Many houses that have been owned for 30 years are now worth $1M so a 3% property tax would be $30,000 a year. 
</div>
 <div id="div3">Those people that retire well usually have real estate and a moderate amount of savings. You give your savings to an investment advisor and they make a plan which spends your savings down to zero. At that point you sell the house you own outright and use that money to move into a retirement community. The investment advisor asks how long do you think you will live. Then they make a plan that spends your assets and savings to zero. If you live past that point you will be on SS Medicare and maybe help from your family. 
</div>
 <div id="div1">Next is having a huge amount of assets. People ask "How much money do I need to retire" they usually mean retire at the same quality of life that they had when they stopped working. Well that is different for everyone. But a simple calculation is 20 times the the amount of money you spent the year before you retired. lets say you spent $100,000. 20 times that would be $2M. a 6% return on $2M is $120,000 a year. You spend $100,000 a year and put the extra $20,000 back into your assets so it grows a little to keep up with inflation. 
</div>
 <div id="div2">You can also pay for lonterm care insurance which will cover you if you endup needing nursing services. 
</div> </div> 
<div style="color: white; background-color: blue; margin: 0.5%;">
<h1>Investing in the stock market</h1>
        
   <div id="div1"> When investing in stocks you should first analyzing the downside risk. <br>
    When trading stocks you should be using money you can loose and looking at the upside benefits then the downside risk</div>
    <div id="div2">
    When investing in the stock market a 6-8% return is normal.  This does grow your money but very slowly. <br>
    I you decide to learn how to control your own investmen ts a 20% return is possible.  This difference is massive. <br>
    $100,000 at 8% for 10 years is $215,892 <br>
    $100,000 at 20% for 10 years is $619,173 <br>
    But learning enough to do this is not easy <br> 
    </div>
    <div id="div3">
    Trading options on stocks with chaotic options values doesn't work. <br> 
    </div>
     <div id="div3">
        <h2>Risk in Investing</h2>
        There is risk in everything in life. Many of those risks are so small that paying attention to them just causes noise. 
        <br>
        The trick then is deciding which risks to study and wich to ignore. In finance that is not really tought anywhere.  
        <br>
        It is almost impossible to become rich without risk. If you believe that trading individual stocks are way to high risk I have a feeling you are either not willing to take the risks to get rich, or you have a path to getting rich that you see as less risky than stocks to you.

 <h1> In the year 2000 Yahoo was way over valued Microsoft was not. When looking at a hot stock today how can you tell if it is a Yahoo or a Microsoft? </h1>
    <br>
    From CNN Money January 12, 1999: 4:35 p.m. ET
    NEW YORK (CNNfn) - <h1>Web portal leader Yahoo! Inc. Tuesday reported fourth-quarter 1998 earnings well ahead of Wall Street estimates as revenues nearly tripled </h1> from year-ago levels. The company, whose shares have soared in recent weeks, also set a 2-for-1 stock split.
    <br>Yahoo! (YHOO) logged proforma earnings of $25 million, or 21 cents a share, on <h1> $76.4 Million in revenue.</h1> Analysts expected the company to post earnings of 16 cents a share.
     Those profits far exceeded the company's year-ago levels, when Yahoo! reported earnings of $1.9 million, or 2 cents a share, on $26.6 million in revenue.
     <br>Yahoo!'s earnings exclude a one-time, $2.1-million charge related to the acquisition of Yoyodyne Entertainment Inc., as well as other charges and amortizations. Including those charges, Yahoo! posted net income of $18.5 million, or 16 cents a share.
     <br>"1998 was another landmark year for Yahoo!," said Tim Koogle, chairman and chief executive. "We consistently and carefully managed the business, executed our original plan and invested in growing the company while increasing profits each quarter."
     Yahoo!'s traffic continues to surge. The company said page views on its global network jumped 16 percent to 167 million per day, compared with 144 million in the third quarter.
     <br>Though analysts consider Yahoo! the clear leader among Web portals - the first site users see when they log onto the Internet - the company face will face tough competition in light of recent industry consolidation, particularly America Online Inc. 's (AOL) proposed $4.2-billion acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp. (NSCP).
     <br>Also, GO Network, a joint portal venture between Infoseek Corp. (SEEK) and Walt Disney Co. (DIS), officially launched Tuesday.
     <br>For the fiscal year 1998, Yahoo! reported earnings of $49.9 million, or 45 cents a share, on $203.3 million in revenue, compared with a 1997 net loss of $425,000, or zero cents a share, on $70.5 million in revenues.
     Separately, Yahoo! set a 2-for-1 stock split for shareholders of record by Jan. 22. The split will be reflected in Yahoo!'s trading price on Feb. 8.
     <br>In Monday trade, Yahoo!'s shares soared above the $400-a-share mark.
     Also, the company expanded the roles of two key executives. President and Chief Executive Tim Koogle will become chairman and CEO, while Jeff Mallett has been named president in addition to his duties as chief operating officer. Both changes are effective immediately.

    From https://news.microsoft.com/1999/07/19/
    <h1>Microsoft Announces Record Fiscal Year Revenue and Income <br>
July 19, 1999</h1> 
REDMOND, Wash., July 19, 1999 — Microsoft Corp. today announced <h1>revenue of $19.75 Billion </h1> for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, a 29 percent increase over the $15.26 billion reported last year. Net income totaled $7.79 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.42, a 69 percent increase compared to $0.84 in fiscal 1998.
<br>
Revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 1999 was $5.76 billion, a 39 percent increase over the comparable quarter in fiscal 1998. For the quarter, net income was $2.20 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $0.40, an increase of 60 percent compared to the $0.25 earned during the same quarter last year.
<br>
“Continuing consumer demand for Microsoft Windows and Office drove another year of fine financial performance,”
said Greg Maffei, chief financial officer.
“Customer enthusiasm also accelerated for our server products, with Windows NT Server, SQL Server and Exchange Server all reporting strong growth. However, in fiscal 2000 our revenue growth rates will decline due to slowing PC demand, uncertainty surrounding Y2K, and uncertain global economic conditions, and we will not see further margin expansion.”
<br>
“Microsoft Office 2000 has resonated with large and small customers alike, and is off to a very strong start,”
said Bob Muglia, senior vice president, Business Productivity Division. Office 2000 Premium, the new high-end version of Office, has been especially popular at retail. Microsoft Office 2000 became available to resellers in the US on June 10, with most other geographies expecting full availability in the September quarter.
<br>
Microsoft®
SQL Server TM 7.0 continued to do well in its second quarter of availability. Independent software vendors (ISVs) worldwide are now shipping more than 1,000 applications for SQL Server 7.0, and many top ISVs have licensed it as part of their enterprise application offerings. Currently, Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 Enterprise Edition owns the top 30 TPC-C price/performance benchmark results.
<br>
Windows NT®
Workstation continued to gain strong acceptance, with the worldwide installed base more than doubling since June 1998 to more than 37 million licensed users. Windows NT Workstation is currently being pre-installed on nearly 30 percent of all business PCs shipped.
<br>
On July 1, the first Release Candidate for the Windows®
2000 family of operating systems was made available to beta customers, developers and partners worldwide. The Windows 2000 family includes: Windows 2000 Professional, the mainstream business client for organizations of all sizes; Windows 2000 Server, for workgroup and department servers; and Windows 2000 Advanced Server, for more robust departmental servers requiring clustering or load balancing support. Windows 2000 DataCenter Server, which is scheduled to ship 90-120 days after the other Windows 2000 products, is targeted at organizations’ most mission-critical servers.
<br>
Microsoft launched MSN TM Personal Home Pages, which let consumers create their own Web page; MSN Mobile, the first major portal to provide wireless information services; and MSN Health, a comprehensive source of health-care information and services on the MSN network of Internet services. Microsoft invested $250 million in the new entity of Healtheon-WebMD and signed a five-year distribution agreement for the new company to become the premier health-care content provider for MSN, the Microsoft WebTV Network TM service and MSNBC.
<br>
During the quarter, Microsoft announced the Microsoft Television Platform Adaptation Kit (TVPAK), which is client and server software that merges Internet and technologies to enable new devices, services and content to enhance the television experience for consumers. More than 30 industry-leading companies are actively working with the technology. AT & T committed to license 7.5 to 10 million units of Microsoft’s client software for advanced set top boxes (ASTB) and agreed to work with Microsoft to feature TVPAK client and server technology in three pilot cities. Subsequent to the quarter, Rogers Communications and Microsoft announced a relationship to develop and deploy advanced broadband television services in Canada. As part of the commitment, Rogers licensed TVPAK client and server software to support at least 1 million ASTBs.
<br>
Demonstrating Microsoft's continuing commitment to accelerating the deployment of broadband Internet connectivity, communications services and wireless opportunities, the Company made or has agreed to make a series of investments including AT & T – $5 billion, Nextel Communications – $600 million, Rogers Communications – $400 million, Sendit AB – $128 million, Concentric Networks – $50 million, Northpoint Communications – $30 million, Wink Communications – $30 million, and others.

    <h1>Yahoo 2003 Valued at $28 Billion</h1>
    y Paul R. La Monica, CNN/Money Senior Writer
    </h1>
    NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Yahoo! Wednesday reported higher first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street forecasts and raised its forecasts for sales and pretax earnings for 2003.
    <br>The Internet media company said it earned $46.7 million, or 8 cents a share, on sales of $283 million for the quarter. Wall Street was expecting earnings of 6 cents a share and revenue of $274 million, according to First Call. The company reported a profit of $10.5 million, or 2 cents a share, excluding a charge from an accounting change, on sales of $193 million a year earlier.
    <br>
    Yahoo!, along with many other Internet stocks, has performed extremely well this year due to expectations of strong earnings and sales growth. Shares of Yahoo! (YHOO: Research, Estimates) are up nearly 40 percent year-to-date.
    The stock sank 3.9 percent ahead of the earnings report Wednesday but gained more than 3.5 percent in after-hours trading, according to Island ECN.
    <h2>Strong gains across the board </h2>
    The company demonstrated strong results throughout its businesses. Advertising revenue jumped 38 percent from a year earlier on strength in sponsored searches (i.e., advertisers paying for higher placement in search results) and other forms of Internet advertising such as banners and pop-ups.
    To that end, Yahoo! CEO Terry Semel said during a conference call Wednesday that traditional ad sales, those not from sponsored searches, also rose more than 10 percent from a year earlier.
    <br>
    Ad revenue accounted for more than two-thirds of Yahoo!'s revenue in the first quarter and the company has been renewing its focus on ad-dependent business, such as its searching capabilities, as the ad market continues to recover. Yahoo! unveiled improvements to its search engine on Monday.
    Fees from services such as a DSL partnership with SBC Communications and premium e-mail products rose 61 percent, and revenue from listings, mainly through Yahoo!'s HotJobs.com site, soared 89 percent.
    <br>
    But Safa Rashtchy, an analyst with US Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said that fee-based revenues, which only increased 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2002, were a bit weaker than he expected.
    <br>
    Looking ahead, Yahoo! said sales for the second quarter should $295 million to $315 million, above analysts' average forecast of $292 million. For the full year, Yahoo! gave revenue guidance of $1.22 billion to $1.28 billion, ahead of the consensus forecast of $1.21 billion.
    <br>
    The company did not provide earnings-per-share targets but said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- watched by many investors -- would be about $85 million to $95 million for the second quarter and between $350 million and $380 million for the full year. The company's previous full-year EBITDA estimate was $295 million to $330 million.
    <br>
    During the conference call, Yahoo! Chief Financial Officer Susan Decker said that barring a big slump in the global economy, the company should be able to hit the higher end of its sales and EBITDA targets.
    What about valuation?
    <br>
    But is this solid performance already priced into Yahoo!'s stock?
    Rashtchy thinks that the shares have more upside because analysts will likely raise their earnings estimates for the year due to the company's upbeat outlook. The current consensus is 30 cents a share. Rashtchy does not own the stock and his firm has no investment banking relationship with it.
    <br>
    Still, Yahoo! trades at 76 times 2003 earnings estimates. Derek Brown, an analyst with Pacific Growth Equities, thinks this is a bit rich, even though the company is doing extremely well.
    <br>
    "The new guidance makes the valuation a bit more palatable, but it is still a bit stretched right now," he said. Brown does not own the stock and Pacific Growth Equities does no investment banking for Yahoo!

    <H1>yahoo value over time </H1>
    
    Verizon on Monday announced the acquisition of beleaguered web company Yahoo Inc for $4.8 billion. The fate of the company was finally sealed after months of speculation and struggle to find a buyer with mounting pressure from investors including Starboard Value LP.
    <br>
    <h1>Yahoo! was valued at over $125 billion at its peak in January 2000 </h1>  Making it the most valuable company in the world at the time. It was all down hill from 2000 for Yahoo as one wrong decision after another continued to haunt the company. 
    <br>
    Yahoo! had the opportunity to buy Google for a paltry $1 million in 1998. But it had not yet created adwords
    <br>
    Today, Google's parent company Alphabet is valued at over $500 billion. this was mainly do to adwords and youtube
    <br>
    The opportunity came back in 2002 but Google's $5 billion price was too high for Yahoo!. 
    <br>
    Instead, Yahoo! acquired Broadcast.com in 1999 for $5.7 billion. 
    <br>
    This was pitted as the worst acquisition deals at the time, according to Econsultancy.com.
    <br>
    Yahoo!, in 2003, bought pay-per-click company called Overture for $1.4 billion. It lost that race to Google AdWords. 
    <br>
    Even acquisition of Flickr and Delicious failed to save the company's plummeting trajectory.
    <br>
    Reports suggest that in 2006, the company came very close to buying Facebook for $1 billion. The deal didn't go through. 
    <br>
    The company's value dropped to approximately $45 billion in February 2008 when Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo's outstanding shares and thereby getting a hold of 61% stake in the company. However, it refused to take the offer. 
    <br>
    By 2012 Yahoo!'s market cap dropped to below $19 billion.
    <br>
    This was when Yahoo! brought on Marissa Mayer as the CEO from Google, to save the ship from sinking.
    <br>
    While Mayer's appointment initially seemed to have worked as Yahoo's value in 2014 increased to $39 billion, however on taking a closer look it was the gains from its stake in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan that resulted in the hike.
    <br>
    She, too, turned to acquisitions and bought Tumblr for over $1 billion in 2013. The company, earlier this year, wrote-down most of this money. 
    <br>
    What's left of Yahoo!? 
    <br>
    Yahoo! owns 24% in Alibaba. 
    
    The value of Alibaba in 2014 had sky-rocketed to $153 billion. 
    <br>
    The company also owns 25% stake in Yahoo Japan which was valued at $32.3 billion in 2014. 
    <br>
    In fact, by 2013 Yahoo started to receive more revenues from its investments in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan than its core business. The stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan had brought the company around $900 million during 2013 in comparison to just over $450 million from the rest of Yahoo.
    <br>
    Following the sale, Yahoo will be left with about $41 billion it invested in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba as well as Yahoo Japan.
