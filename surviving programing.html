  <h1>My voyage of learning to program</h1>
  <p>
    In 1986 I learnd Basic programing language on an AppleII but did not continue that education beyond that.  In 2003 I wrote a very simple website using simple html with notepad as my editor. So when I decided to try programing in 2021 I was wondering where I should start.  I decided to write a single small html page using notepad then focuse on what tools I should use to edit and post that to the web.  I did not want to use a website creator, I had done that in 2010 and now the site is not editable unless I want to learn their tool again since they change it every coulple years.  I did not want to use a technology that would change constantly.  I talked to my brother and he gave me this list of tools to learn. <br>
    VScode for file creation and editing <br>
    bash terminal  <br>
    git and github for code management <br>
    Azure static website for hosting my page <br>
    godaddy for buying my domain and dealing with DNS <br>
    
  </p>
</div>
<div id="div1">  this is what the first section of each page should look like <br>

  </div>
  
  <div id="div2"> <p>this is formated as a paragraph, <br>
     there will be videos here eventually
    <br>
    now I am doing a third section just like the first
    <br>
    and a 4th section just like the 2nd </p>
  </div>

  
<div id="div1">

  showing how to train an AI <br>
  make a 4x4 board, you start on a1 and want to get to d4<br>
  put a clear box on each square with colorred tokens inside each color for a direction<br>
  once it gets to d4 then we remove each token of a wrong move <br>
  this is judging each move<br>
  
  now instead lets just judge the outcome<br>
  if it get to d4 in 4 moves we leave all the tokens otherwise we remove evey token pulled<br>
  this wont work very well, so allow it 10 moves if it does it put everything back if not remove everything<br>
  once it is good at that reduce it to 9 moves, then 8, then 7, ect<br>
  next do it again but when it gets it right put 3 of that color back in the box<br>
  
  now write that program so it doesnt need to be in the real world<br>
  now goto tick tack toe and link to the original experiment<br>
  talk about chess this way but it doesnt have to finish every game just get 5 points ahead<br>
  then give it everybook ever written and ask it what comes after "Where is my cat"<br>
  </p>

  <div id="div2">
  show every step you took to make your website but start with a 4 line html document made with note pad. then show a hyperlink and explaine documents no longer need to be linier. then talk about editors. indenting multiple lines color coding script autocompleation ect. then go through how you built your site one page and one command at a time. If you make a video inclued new tags in the description.

    <p>when figuring out how to make the hamburger my other content would cover it up. I learned about the CCS position: static|absolute|fixed|relative|sticky|initial|inherit; attribute. Once understanding that I was able to fix it. </p>
